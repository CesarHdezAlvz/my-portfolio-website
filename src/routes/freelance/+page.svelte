		name="CÃ©sar Hernandez"
		title="A bit about me"
		paragraph1="I am a doctor in Medical Engineering, with experience in R&D projects related to optical imaging, image processing and Deep Learning. I started Web development as a side hustle but it's becoming more of a reality."
		paragraph2="In my research, I'm particularly interested in AI solutions applied to imaging (bonus points if it's medical), combining clean code practices and optimisation. As a web developer, I like to create and design web applications and sites with user-centered design to deliver exceptional digital experiences, always adapted to the client's needs."
